# SCALE


To run the integrated script I provided (for research, prompt generation, report creation, and Argue-Eval scoring), follow these steps:

1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed in your Python environment:

Python 3.8 or newer
Required packages:
gpt_researcher
argue_eval
pandas
asyncio
transformers
deprecated
Install missing packages, for example:

bash
pip install pandas transformers deprecated
You may need to install gpt_researcher and argue_eval via their respective GitHub repos or pip if available (consult their docs).

2. Prepare Configuration and Context Files
config.dawn.Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct.json
instruction_sets.json
Fill in your context and doc_dict variables in the script (replace '...' and {...} with your actual data).
3. Save the Script
Save the script provided above in a file, e.g.:

bash
nano run_research_report.py
Paste the code, and save.

4. Run the Script
In your terminal, from the directory where the script and config files are located:

bash
python run_research_report.py
This will execute the workflow:

Create prompt variants
Generate reports
Score them with Argue-Eval
Save results to reports_with_argue_eval.csv
5. Check Output
Look for the file:

reports_with_argue_eval.csv
Open it in Excel, Google Sheets, or with pandas to see the prompt variants, generated reports, and their evaluation.
Troubleshooting
If you see import errors, ensure all packages are installed and accessible in your Python environment.
If you get "file not found" errors, check the paths to your config and instruction files.
If you need to run the script as a Jupyter notebook, let me know and I can adapt it for you.
